# operator precedence is same in python as in maths


# there are different types of comparision operators also available 
#   <
#   >
#   =
#   ==
#   <=
#   >=
#   !=


# Logical Operator : and or not

print(v < 5 or v2 < 4)    # one of the condition have to be true
print(not v2 > 50)    # reverse conditon of printing boolean value
