## Conclusion
At this point, I'm familiar with the basics of using Python exceptions. After seeing the difference between syntax errors and exceptions, you learned about various ways to raise, catch, and handle exceptions in Python. You also learned how you can create your own custom exceptions.

In this article, I gained experience working with the following exception-related keywords:

1. raise allows you to raise an exception at any time.
2. assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and raises an exception if it isnâ€™t.
3. In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
4. except allows you to catch and handle the exception or exceptions that Python encountered in the try clause.
5. else lets you code sections that should run only when Python encounters no exceptions in the try clause.
6. finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, whether or not Python encountered any exceptions.
